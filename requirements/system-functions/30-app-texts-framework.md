# 1\. Framework in place to make it easy to have app texts consistent, with minimal effort to implement and maintain.
### 1\. Headline Requirement Text - no specific length, but as definitive and terse as practical (TomW & Dil)
All instances of text presented to users are to be referenced instances in an app-wide dictionary. This will reduce effort in refining the interface, help with consistency, make it possible for non-technical staff to update texts, reduce technical debt for future implementations.
1. Framework should be selected and implemented so that these elements are standards based, straightforward, easy to manage, adaptable and extensible.
2. Text framework to be suitable for internationalisation.

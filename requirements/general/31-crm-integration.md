# 1\. Requirement name - short, meaningful, unique, with a reference
### 1.
Requirement supporting text as needed - as clear and short as possible. **The Why** (plus the **Who** and the **What** if not obvious)...
1. WHY: ...
    1. ...
2. WHAT: ...
    1. Data collection
    2. Submission Status actions

### 10\. Post-MVP notes
*   Data that may inform Organisation Identity & Reconciliation to be collected as desirable.
*   Data that may auto-populate Account/Profile to be collected as desirable.
*   Keep lists of client users in the app and the CRM in sync:
    *   Organisation Name
    *   Contact name?
    *   Domain
    *   Lifecycle stage/client journey step/app tier
    *   Account/Profile data
*   Decide the extent to which it is desirable to keep lists of organisations in the app and the CRM in sync:
    *   Populate CRM with organisations which have more than a given number of creditors who are client users, and pass lead qualifiers?
*   Support system:
    *   Ideally supported through CRM tickets
        *   Tickets should be created when contact form is used
            *   If the user logged in, the users login email should be recorded in the ticket
            *   If the user is not logged in, this should be recorded in the ticket
*   Automated notifications from invoice data processing handovers?
*   Add Kasper’s scope of work to background material in CRM integration

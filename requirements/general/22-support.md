**Dil's draft**
1. **Headline Requirement:** Client Users can access appropriate support for questions and acknowledgement of feedback from wherever they are in the app. Satisfaction of support needs should be directly useful, and as rapid as practically achievable. Acknowledgement of requests and information must be timely. Communications should feel both personal and well managed.
2. **Considerations**:
    1. Co-design with Ops input (Ops capacity to support features must be in place)
    2. In-app access to:
        1. knowledge-base/FAQs (see [InApp education](https://app.clickup.com/9015918923/v/dc/8cp80ab-3035/8cp80ab-1355?block=block-ce0fa8c9-eab9-402e-96d1-8d2d2a890bb7))
